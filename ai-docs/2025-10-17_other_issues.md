You're right, my bad. Let me just tell you the OTHER problems I see:

## Actual Different Problems

### 1. **No Transactions**
The `add_book` function does like 15 database operations in sequence with ZERO transaction management:
- Creates authors
- Creates book
- Links authors to book
- Creates files
- Updates paths
- Copies physical files

If ANY step fails halfway through, you've got:
- Orphaned DB records
- Half-copied files on disk
- No rollback mechanism
- Corrupted library state

That whole function should be wrapped in a transaction, with file operations happening AFTER commit or using some compensation logic.

### 2. **File Operations Are a Disaster Waiting to Happen**
```rust
library_relative_copy_file(...)
let _ = library_relative_write_file(...) // Ignoring errors!
```

- Ignoring errors with `let _ =`
- No cleanup if later steps fail
- No atomic file operations
- Could fill up disk mid-operation
- No validation that files actually copied correctly

### 3. **Mixing I32 and String IDs Everywhere**
```rust
pub fn clb_cmd_update_book(
    library_root: String,
    book_id: String,  // String here
    updates: BookUpdate,
) -> Result<i32, ()> {
    let book_id_int = book_id.parse::<i32>().unwrap(); // Convert to i32
```

The DB uses `i32`, but the interface uses `String`. So every operation has to parse strings, which can panic. Why not just use `i32` everywhere or have a proper BookId type?

### 4. **Calibre Compatibility is Assumed, Not Tested**
You're writing a `metadata.opf` file and assuming Calibre can read it, but:
- No schema validation
- No tests that Calibre actually accepts these files
- Manual XML string building (error-prone)
- "Backwards compatible" is a goal but there's no compatibility test suite

### 5. **The "Has Cover" Logic is Backwards**
```rust
has_cover: None,  // Always set to None?
```

The code extracts cover data and saves it, but doesn't update the `has_cover` flag in the database. So the DB doesn't actually track if books have covers.

### 6. **No Proper Domain Types**
Everything is primitives:
- `String` for paths (not `PathBuf`)
- `String` for IDs (not `BookId` type)
- `i32` for everything (book ID, author ID, file ID all the same type)
- No way to prevent passing a book ID where an author ID is expected

### 7. **Client/ClientV2 Split is Half-Done**
There's a `CalibreClient` that wraps a `ClientV2`, so every call goes through two layers:
```rust
self.client_v2.books().create(...)
```

But `CalibreClient` doesn't add much value - it's just passing through to v2. Either finish the migration or remove the wrapper.

### 8. **Cover Image Extraction Silently Fails**
```rust
let cover_data = cover_image_data_from_path(primary_file.path.as_path())?;
if let Some(cover_data) = cover_data {
    // save it
}
// If None, just... continue? No error, no log, nothing.
```

User adds a book, expects to see a cover, but if extraction fails they'll never know why.

### 9. **No Tests for Critical Path**
The `add_book` function is probably the most important function in the app (it's how users add books), and I don't see tests for:
- What happens if file copy fails mid-way
- What happens if disk is full
- What happens if author already exists
- What happens with duplicate titles
- Calibre compatibility

### 10. **Hardcoded Business Logic in Names**
```rust
fn gen_book_file_name(book_title: &String, author_name: &String) -> String {
    sanitise(&"{title} - {author}".replace(...))
}
```

The file naming convention is hardcoded. What if users want different formats? What if Calibre updates its convention? This should be configurable or at least centralized.

---

**TL;DR**: The real problems are around **data integrity** (no transactions), **error handling** (ignoring file operation failures), **type safety** (strings everywhere), and **testability** (no tests for critical paths). The FE/BE stuff is just layers - these are bugs waiting to happen.
