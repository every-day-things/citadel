# Citadel Architecture: Executive Summary

**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: Recommendations Phase
**Impact**: High - Development Velocity & Maintainability

---

## Problem Statement

Citadel's current architecture requires touching 4-5 files for simple CRUD operations, slowing development velocity. The goal of supporting both local (Tauri) and remote (web) deployment modes has resulted in over-abstraction without delivering working remote functionality.

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Multi-layer abstraction overhead** - Too many layers without clear benefits
2. **Inconsistent error handling** - Mix of error types, silent failures, aggressive `.unwrap()` usage
3. **Concurrency bottlenecks** - `Arc<Mutex<>>` serializing all database operations
4. **State management fragmentation** - Multiple disconnected systems (Svelte stores, React Context, event emitters)
5. **Manual event orchestration** - Components must manually emit and listen to events
6. **Incomplete remote implementation** - 90% stub methods, abstraction doesn't deliver value

**Bottom Line**: Current architecture optimizes for theoretical flexibility at the cost of practical development speed.

## Recommended Architecture

### Store-Based Pattern with Adapter Layer

```
React Components
    ↓ (use hooks)
Domain Stores (Svelte stores)
    ↓ (call adapters)
Backend Adapter (Tauri OR Remote)
    ↓
Tauri Commands / HTTP API
```

### Why This Works

**For Tauri Mode (Current Priority)**:
- Direct path: Store → Adapter → Tauri command → SQLite
- No caching needed (DB is fast enough)
- Simple error handling sufficient
- N+1 queries acceptable (~1ms each)

**For Remote Mode (Future)**:
- Same store interface
- Adapter handles differences (caching, batching, etc.)
- Progressive enhancement as needed
- No changes to components

### Key Benefits

✅ **2-3 files per feature** instead of 4-5
✅ **Automatic UI updates** via store subscriptions
✅ **Built-in caching** at store level
✅ **Optimistic updates** for instant UI feedback
✅ **Easy testing** - mock adapter only
✅ **Incremental migration** - run old and new in parallel

## Development Workflow Comparison

### Adding "Mark as Favorite" Feature

**Current Approach** (4-5 files):
1. Define in `libcalibre/dtos/`
2. Implement in `libcalibre/client.rs`
3. Add Tauri command in `src-tauri/src/libs/calibre/mod.rs`
4. Add to TypeScript service in `src/lib/services/library/`
5. Update component + manually emit event

**Recommended Approach** (2-3 files):
1. Add to adapter interface & implement
2. Add method to store (with optimistic update)
3. Use in component

```typescript
// That's it!
const { toggleFavorite } = useBooks();
await toggleFavorite(book.id);
```

**Time Saved**: ~40-60% per feature

---

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Svelte Stores in React

Already invested in Svelte stores for settings. Extend this pattern:

```typescript
// Store definition
export const booksStore = createBooksStore();

// React hook bridge
export const useBooks = () => {
  const state = useSyncExternalStore(
    booksStore.subscribe,
    () => { /* get current value */ }
  );
  // ... return API
};
```

### 2. Adapter Pattern

Single interface, dual implementations:

```typescript
interface BackendAdapter {
  listBooks(): Promise<LibraryBook[]>;
}

// Tauri: Simple and direct
class TauriAdapter {
  async listBooks() {
    return commands.clbQueryListAllBooks(this.libraryPath);
  }
}

// Remote: Add optimizations as needed
class RemoteAdapter {
  async listBooks() {
    // Can add caching, batching, etc. without affecting stores
    return fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/books`).then(r => r.json());
  }
}
```

### 3. Optimistic Updates

Best user experience - UI updates instantly, rollback only on error:

```typescript
async updateBook(bookId, updates) {
  const original = getCurrentBook(bookId);

  // Update UI immediately
  updateLocally(bookId, updates);

  try {
    await adapter.updateBook(bookId, updates);
  } catch (error) {
    // Only rollback on error
    updateLocally(bookId, original);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Create adapter pattern (`src/adapters/backend.ts`)
- Create `useStore` hook for React/Svelte bridge
- Add proper error types

### Phase 2: Pilot Feature (Week 2-3)
- Migrate books OR authors to new pattern
- Validate approach with real usage
- Refine patterns based on feedback

### Phase 3: Gradual Migration (Week 3-6)
- Migrate remaining features one at a time
- Run old and new systems in parallel
- Use feature flags for controlled rollout

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Week 6-8)
- Remove old patterns once migration complete
- Update documentation
- Add remote mode optimizations as needed

**Key Tactic**: Keep old system working while building new. No "big bang" rewrite.

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- **Technical feasibility**: Proven patterns (Svelte stores, adapter pattern)
- **Incremental migration**: Can run systems in parallel
- **Rollback capability**: Simple feature flags to disable
- **Team familiarity**: Already using Svelte stores

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- **Learning curve**: Some React devs may be unfamiliar with Svelte stores
- **Migration effort**: Requires dedicated time (6-8 weeks estimated)
- **Testing burden**: Need to test both Tauri and remote modes

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive documentation (✅ complete)
- Pilot with one feature first
- Feature flags for safe rollout
- Team training/knowledge sharing sessions

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Costs
- **Initial setup**: ~40 hours (adapter, stores, hooks, first feature)
- **Migration effort**: ~80 hours (migrate existing features)
- **Learning curve**: ~20 hours (team familiarization)
- **Total**: ~140 hours (~3.5 weeks for one developer)

### Benefits
- **Feature development speed**: 40-60% faster (ongoing)
- **Reduced bug surface**: Single source of truth, automatic updates
- **Better testability**: Mock adapter vs. multiple layers
- **Improved UX**: Optimistic updates, automatic caching
- **Future-proof**: Easy to add remote mode when ready

**ROI**: Pays back in ~4-6 months of feature development

---

## Decision Points

### Go / No-Go Criteria

**Proceed if**:
- ✅ Team agrees on direction
- ✅ Can allocate 3-4 weeks for migration
- ✅ Pilot feature validates approach
- ✅ No immediate critical bugs blocking resources

**Defer if**:
- ❌ Team fundamentally disagrees with approach
- ❌ Major release deadline in next 6 weeks
- ❌ Pilot reveals unforeseen issues
- ❌ Remote mode becomes immediately critical (requires different priorities)

### Alternative: Minimal Changes

If full migration is too much, minimum viable improvements:

1. **Fix error handling** - Return proper error types (not `()`)
2. **Consolidate state** - Pick ONE state management approach
3. **Remove event emitters** - Use store subscriptions
4. **Document adapter pattern** - For new features only

This gives 30-40% of benefits with 10-20% of effort.

## Conclusion

Citadel's current architecture is **over-engineered for theoretical flexibility** that isn't being used. The recommended store-based architecture is **pragmatic, proven, and well-suited** to the dual-mode requirement while dramatically improving development velocity.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with phased migration starting with a pilot feature.

**Expected Outcome**: 40-60% faster feature development, better UX through optimistic updates, clearer architecture that's easier to understand and maintain.

**Next Step**: Team review and decision on pilot feature.
