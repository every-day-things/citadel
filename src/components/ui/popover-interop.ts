 * Kit popovers (e.g. the TagsInput completion list) render in body portals so

 * "outside" and would close on click, and the modal pointer-events lock would
 * make them inert. Popover roots carry this attribute; dialogs use the guard
 * to ignore interactions inside them, and the CSS module sets
 * pointer-events: auto on the popover itself.
